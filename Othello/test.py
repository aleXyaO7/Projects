Suppose player 1 has just played, and the evaluation gives a score for player 1. Start the total score at 0. For each corner position occupied by player 1, add 1000000. For each safe edge position, add 5000. Then, subtract the number of opponent's possible moves, but don't count an opponent's move if it is in a cx position with an empty corner. Subtract an extra 20 for each possible corner move for the opponent and subtract an extra 1 for each possible safe edge move for the opponent.
